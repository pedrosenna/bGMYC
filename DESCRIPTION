Description: This package implements a Bayesian version of the general mixed Yule-coalescent model for species delimitation introduced by Pons et al. 2006. It uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the posterior distribution of the model and uses a flexible method of specifying prior distributions on the model parameters.
